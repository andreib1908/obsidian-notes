# Definition

An **interval** is a [[Sets#Definition|set]] of [[Sets#Sets of Numbers|real numbers]] with the property that if **two numbers** are in the set, then **all other numbers** in between those two are also in the set.

*Example*:
- (*a*,*b*) = {*x* in *R* | *a* < *x* < *b*}
- `[`a*,*b*) = {*x* in *R* | *a* <= *x* < *b*}
etc.
