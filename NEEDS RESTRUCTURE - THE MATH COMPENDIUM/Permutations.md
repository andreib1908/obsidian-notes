**ORDER IS IMPORTANT**
# Definition

A **permutation** of *n* **distinct** objects *x1, x2, ..., xn* is an **ordering** of these *n* objects.

The number of permutations of *n* **distinct** objects is equal to:
`n!` = `1 * 2 * 3 *...*n`

`0! = 1`

# r-permutation (arrangements)

Let:
- *S* be a [[Sets#Definition|set]] with *n* elements
- 0 <= *r* <= *n*

An **r-permutation** (of elements of S) is a permutation n of *r* **distinct** elements of *S*:
- Denoted by *P(n, r)*

How to calculate:
1. *P(n,r)* by  [[Reader Introduction to Mathematics-1.pdf#page=59|Example 3.2.3]]
