[[random variable]]
- A discrete random variable is one that takes on a countable number of distinct values.
- The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is described by a probability mass function (PMF), which gives the probability of each possible outcome.
- Examples of discrete random variables include the number of heads in a series of coin tosses, the number of defects in a batch of products, or the number of students who pass an exam.
