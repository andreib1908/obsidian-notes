Let:
- *A* and *B* be [[Sets]].

If every *x* from *A* is also found in *B*, then *A* is a **subset** of *B*.
### Example

Let:
- *A* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- *B* = {2, 4, 6}
- *C* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Then:
- *B* `is` a **subset** of *A*
- *C* `is` a **subset** of *A*
- *A* `is not` a **subset** of *B*
- *A* `is not` a **subset** of *C*
- *B* `is not` a **subset** of *C* 
	- Not every element of *B* is in *C*
- *C* `is not` a **subset** of *B*

# Equivalent Sets

Two [[Sets|sets]] *A* and *B* are **equal** if they have the same elements.

So, if *A* = *B* then *A* is a **subset** of *B* `AND` *B* is a **subset** of *A* (at the same time).
- This holds the other way around too.

# Proper Subset

Let:
- *A* and *B* be [[Sets|sets]].
- **Every** element of *A* is also an element of *B*
- There is **at least one** element of *B* that **is not** in *A*.
	- In other words, *A* is a subset of *B*, but *A* != *B*.

Therefore, *A* is a **proper subset** of *B*.
