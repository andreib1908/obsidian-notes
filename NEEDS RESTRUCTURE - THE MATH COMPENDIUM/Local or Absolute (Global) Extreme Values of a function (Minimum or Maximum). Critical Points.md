Critical points may or may not be extreme values as well. If you restrict your search for a certain interval inside `[a, b]`, then they might become local extremes.

For finding the crit points, **don't forget to check both steps 1 and 2 as you might miss out on some values**.

# Condition to have extreme values on an interval (Checklist)

The function **f** must have the following properties (at the same time):
- **f** is *continuous* ([[Continuous Functions (Limits)]]) on a **CLOSED INTERVAL** (it doesn't have any jumps)
- **f** is *bounded* (so it does not go to infinity or -infinity like `[0, inf) or (inf, 10] or (inf, inf) = R`)
- **f** is *closed* on an interval (`[a, b]` not `[a, b)` or `(a, b]` or `(a, b)`)
