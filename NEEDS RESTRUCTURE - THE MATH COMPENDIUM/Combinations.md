**ORDER IS NOT IMPORTANT**

# Definition

Let:
- *S* be a [[Sets#Definition|set]] with *n* elements
- 0 <= *r* <= *n* 

An **r-combination** is a selection of *r* elements from *S*.

You read it: *n choose r*

Sometimes, a **combination** is also called **the binomial coefficient**.

Combinations of *n* taken as *r* produce a **number of subsets**
from *S* with *r* elements
