For the line going through the point P and Q, we will form the vector **PQ** to work with instead of **v**. Afterwards, we follow the parametrizing rules with x, y and z.

Here they took a look at the given equation and point. If you look at the [[Equations of lines and planes (vectors)#Parametric Equations for a Line (parametrizing a line)|way to parametrize a line]], you can see that x is written like x0 + tv1, therefore we can state exactly the contents of the origin point we call *P* and the vector **v** we will work with for the distance formula. *This is how they got to the solution you see there. They didn't show all the work.*

Afterwards, you just apply what you know about [[The Cross Product]] and you plug it into the formula for **distance between a point and a line**.

So, the normal vector **n** is usually given to you like in example 6. Afterwards, it's pretty straight forward to replace the `A, B, C` values into the **component equation**.

This example is also useful when you have three points to work with. You just form to vectors, like **AB** and **AC**, since their **cross product is basically the normal vector n**. You take those values from your cross product and you plug them into the component equation.

# Lines of Intersection and Parallel planes

Two planes are **parallel** *if and only if* their normals are parallel, or `n1 = kn2`, for some scalar k.

Two planes are **not parallel** *if and only if* they intersect in a line.

Here they say that the cross product between **n1** and **n2** would be parallel to the two normal vectors themselves, **n1 and n2**. They got the values for **n1** and **n2** by using the two equations they gave us and looking at the [[Equations of lines and planes (vectors)#Equation for a Plane in Space|simplified component equation for a plane]], where they selected their `A, B and C`. *They didn't show all the work.*
