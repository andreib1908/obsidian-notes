1. 
**A random variable** is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon. It is a variable that can take on different values based on the outcome of a random event or process. 

Random variables can be classified into two main types: [[Discrete Random Variables]] and [[Continuous Random Variables]].

They are usually used in *probability functions* and are given a letter to describe an event in relation to a possible variable:
