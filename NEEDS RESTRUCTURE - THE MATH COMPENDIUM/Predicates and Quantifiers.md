### Universal Quantifier ∀

Let:
- *p(x)* denote a **predicate**
- ∀*x*(*p(x)*) is true when *p(x)* is true for **all x** from some specified domain.

### Existential Quantifier ∃

Let:
- *p(x)* denote a **predicate**
- ∃*x*(*p(x)*) is true when *p(x)* is true for **at least one x** from some specified domain.

Now consider the following proposition: 
- ∃x (p(x) ∧ q(x)). 

We want to know whether there exists at least one x for which both x^3 − 2x^2 + x = 2 and x^2 − 4 = 0 are true. 
- For x = 2, both equalities are true. Thus we have found one x, hence ∃x (p(x) ∧ q(x)) is true.

If *p(x)* is a **predicate**, the prepositions:
