[[random variable]]
- A continuous random variable is one that can take on any value within a specified range or interval.
- The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is described by a probability density function (PDF), which indicates the likelihood of the variable falling within a particular range.
- Examples of continuous random variables include the height of a person, the time it takes for a computer to execute a task, or the temperature at a given location.
