*R^2* means you only use the *X* and *Y* axis for coordinates/planes
*R^3* means you use the *Z* axis in addition to *X* and *Y* for coordinates/planes

# The distance between two points

- The distance between the points *P(x1, y1, z1)* and *Q = (x2, y2, z2)* is defined as:

# Spheres

- Has center *P*
- Radius *r* >= 0
- Is the [[Sets#Definition|set]] of all points *X* in *R^3* with **distance** *r* to *P*.
