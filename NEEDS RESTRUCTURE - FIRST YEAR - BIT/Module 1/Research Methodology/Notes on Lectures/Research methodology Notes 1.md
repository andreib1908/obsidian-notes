# 1. What is Methodology

- required research skills
	- what am i researching, 
	- what is the issue i want to solve, 
	- how can i solve it
	- what needs to be improved

Research proccess:
	- problem identification
	- problem analysis
	- solution design
	- improvement
	- something else

Methodology = "how can i conduct my research"
- systematically and transparently search for evidence-based answers and/or solutions

**Problem -> Solution (through methodology)**

# 2. Research types

## A) Lack of knowledge

- **Fundamental research**
	- expend knowledge regarding reality by new discoveries
	- solve knowledge problems with the aim to improve scientific theories for understanding and predictions

- **Knowledge problem**
	- 1. Variable(s)
	- 2. Relationships
	- 3. Research population

You can come up with a research hypothesis and through research see if you were right or wrong.

There is an **8 step research cycle** currently used *(check slides)*.
	- Research goal -> Problem Statement -> ... -> Analysis -> Conclusions


## B) Organizational problem solving

**Applied research**
- Changing the perceived discrepancy between norm and reality.
- Aimed at application of existing knowledge and methods to solve practical problems.

First you research about related topics, then you think of a good solution for practicality. (like trash spot in ocean being picked up -> you first research about waves, wind etc.)

**Theory and research methods are applied, and not being tested.**

## C) Approach comparisons

Fundamnetal research -> how can we achieve it? theoretically? *usually a question*

Applied research -> HERE is how we do this, practically *usually a statement*

*How to improve IT systems* -> APPLIED
*How to improve IT systems, **according to research*** -> FUNDAMENTAL

What is the effect of different pricing strategies on the companus image among customers?
-> fundamental research

## D) Research practice-gap

Research practice gap vs design science approach 

# 3. Research Process

## A) Alternative methodologies

It's an iterative process, not linear
(Saunders et al 2019 research methodology proposal)

There is also Peffers et al 2007 proposal.

## B) Research General

- Research the problem
- Research the problem from a theoretical perspective
- Main research -> **main focus here**
- Implications
