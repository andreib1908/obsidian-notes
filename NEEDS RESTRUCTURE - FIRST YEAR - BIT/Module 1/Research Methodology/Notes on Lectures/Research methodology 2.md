# Problem identification

First you have to identify a problem prior to analysis.

Potential problems:
- no quality check prior to shipment
- if one product is failing maybe others have the same issue
- lack of worker training -> impacting production
- working place not organized, can be a mess 

- Search for problems
	- think for yourself
	- what is the problem
	- are there other problems to solve first

Problem identification questions to ask (*find them on canvas lecture slides - slide 15*)

- Data gathering methods (apply multiple alternatives)
	- people can blame each other they aren't working

Problem Inventory
 - there might be more than one problem
 - norms reality and perceptions differences
 - result is a mess
 - problem clean up required
 - stakeholder analysis could help

# Core problem selection

Core problem -> problem at the base of problem graph (*slide 27*)

# Problem statement

## idk cant remember title

- go back in the causal chain
- leave out what you don't know
- leave out what you cant influence
- take the most relevant of the remaining candidates

## Action problem

Action problem definition
1. variable
2. norm
3. reality
4. problem owner

see example of a bad statement at *slide 35*

see example of a good one at *slide 39*

### Assignment
*slide 46*

**Variable**: Wait times at hospitals - patient throughput time
**Norm**: 30 minutes for both GP and ED (average wait times) - 120 minutes
**Reality**: Large queues at ED and next-to-no-one at GP - 159 minutes
	- gap of 24.5% between norm and reality
**Problem Owner**: The Hospital/Management - Emergency Department of Hospital X

**Action problem statement**:
- The patients throughput time should be reduced by 24.5% (from 159 mins to 120 mins) for the Emergency department...
