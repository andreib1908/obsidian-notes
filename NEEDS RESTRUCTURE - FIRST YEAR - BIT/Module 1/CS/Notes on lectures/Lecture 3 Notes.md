# Types

You can see type as a [[Sets|set]].

# Basic sequence types

Sequences are Data Structures.

- Tuples
	- are immutable
- Lists
	- are not immutable
- one more

### Tuples

![[Pasted image 20230912140304.png]]

**TUPLE WITH ONE VALUE MUST HAVE THE EXTRA COMMA, OTHERWISE RIP**
- This is how you differentiate a tuple with a single value from an int.

You can slice tuples:

*you start with index 0*
- When we are slicing we don't use parenthesis

Tuples can be concatenated:

Tuples can have elements of any type. **You can have tuples of strings, integer and more all in one.**

Basic operations:

Built-in functions with tuples:

### Lists

![[Pasted image 20230912141206.png]]
- So they differ from tuples. With a single value you don't need the coma.

Lists can be sliced like strings:

- The last thing is **reversing the list**.

Lists can be concatenated:

Things get tricky with *max* and *min*.

Lists can be made of all elements. 

**Python always checks lists in alphabetical order.**
- This gets screwed up when you have elements of all types.

For **strings** *max* and *min* check alphabetically:

Lists built-in functions:

**SORTING**

wow this is amazing

**Sorting with reverse is not the same as the reversing function.**
