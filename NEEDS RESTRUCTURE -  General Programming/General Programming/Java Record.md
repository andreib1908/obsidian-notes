- **Java Beans**: A Java Bean is a special kind of POJO (Plain Old Java Object). It adheres to certain conventions:
        - It must have a no-argument constructor.
        - It should be serializable.
        - Properties are accessed via getter and setter methods.
        - Often used for more complex data structures where behavior is as important as data.
    - **Java Records** (introduced in Java 16): Records are a way to create simple and immutable data carrier classes. A record is defined with a concise syntax and automatically provides:
        - A private final field for each component of the record.
        - A public constructor.
        - Public getter methods (but no setter methods as they are immutable).
        - `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations.
        - Designed to model simple data aggregates with less boilerplate.

- **Mutability**:
    
    - **Java Beans** are mutable by default since they typically include setter methods to modify field values.
    - **Java Records** are immutable; their field values are set when the record is created and cannot be changed afterwards.
- **Use Cases**:
    
    - **Java Beans** are more suitable for situations where you need a mutable object, or when you require additional functionality like business logic, validation, or property change support.
    - **Java Records** are ideal for simple data carriers, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and in scenarios where immutability is desired, such as in functional programming or for ensuring thread safety.
