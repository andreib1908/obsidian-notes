# Definitions 

- **Machine reasoning** is the explicit knowledge representation + inferences (=reasoning) to derive new knowledge.
- Examples of how a machine would think:
	- Normally I have a slice of bread to eat.  
	- I always have a warm drink and a juice.  
	- If I have an early meeting, I eat yoghurt.  
	- I donâ€™t drink coffee with yoghurt.
