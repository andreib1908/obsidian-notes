# models general

An assignment of truth values (true or false) for [[0 - General Notions|atoms]] is called a **model**.

Models can look like:
- "world"
- "rain" is true
- "P(1,1)" (in Wumpus World means 'Pit' at square 1,1) is false
- p ^ q false
- etc.

We visualize models by means of a [[Propositions and Truth Values|truth table]]:

Here we have 4 models concerning P, Q and the relations between them.
