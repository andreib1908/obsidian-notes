# validation set

This is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the [[training set]] while tuning the model's hyperparameters. This set is crucial because it can give you insight into how the model will perform on unseen data without touching the [[test set]]. 

The validation set acts as a proxy for the [[test set]] during the model development phase.

The validation set, in relation to the [[training set]] and the [[test set]], represents a smaller portion of the overall data, typically around 10-15%.
