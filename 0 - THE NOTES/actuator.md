# actuator

**Actuators** are the *mechanisms* through which an AI [[agent]] affects or acts upon its environment. They are like the muscles of the system. Examples include:

1. **Motors and Servos**: Enable movement in robots, allowing them to walk, move arms, or manipulate objects.
2. **Speakers**: Convert electrical signals into sound, used in voice assistants to communicate with users.
3. **Displays**: Show visual information or feedback, like on a smartphone or computer screen.
4. **Relays and Switches**: Control other devices, often used in home automation to turn appliances on or off.
