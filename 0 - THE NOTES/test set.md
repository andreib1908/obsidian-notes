# test set

After the model has been [[training set|trained]] and hyperparameters have been tuned using the [[validation set]], the final model performance is evaluated on the test set. 

This is the data that the model has never seen before, and it provides the final measure of how well the model is expected to perform in the real world.

In relation to the training set and validation set, the test set is a subset of the overall data that remains after splitting it for training and validation. The remaining portion is typically around 10-15%.
