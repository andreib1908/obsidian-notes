# model checking

Model checking is a method used in computer science and formal verification to check whether a model of a given system satisfies certain properties. 

In the context of logic and AI, when you see the notation "KB |= Alpha", it is referring to model checking. Here, "KB" stands for knowledge base, and "Alpha" represents a specific proposition or a set of properties. 

The notation "KB |= Alpha" means that in all models or interpretations where the knowledge base KB is true, the proposition Alpha is also true. This approach is often used to ensure that a system behaves correctly across all possible scenarios it might encounter. Model checking is automated and checks exhaustively through all possible states.

In other words, it refers to [[entailment]].
