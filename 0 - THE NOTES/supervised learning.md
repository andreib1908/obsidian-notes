# supervised learning

Labels are provided for data that we are going to hand out to an [[agent]].

See references for related concepts.

# Splitting the data into different sets

In supervised learning, it is very important to preprocess our data before testing it on the real world. This is the modelling step in supervised learning.

Given a large dataset with many features and labels, we will usually split it into three different sets:
1. [[training set]]
2. [[validation set]]
3. [[test set]]

This is part of the [[validation]] procedure for data, also known as preprocessing. Click it to see a more in-depth explanation.
