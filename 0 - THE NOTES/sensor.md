**Sensors** are the *tools* an [[agent|agent]] uses to perceive or gather information from its environment. They function similarly to human senses like sight, hearing, touch, etc. In AI systems, sensors can take various forms depending on the application, such as:

1. **Cameras and Microphones**: Used in visual and auditory perception. For example, robots use cameras to navigate or interpret visual information.
2. **Thermometers and Pressure Sensors**: Detect temperature changes or pressure, important in industrial automation.
3. **Proximity Sensors and Lidar**: Used for measuring distance or detecting objects nearby. This is crucial in autonomous vehicles.
4. **Touch Sensors**: Similar to the human sense of touch, used in robotics to understand physical interactions.
