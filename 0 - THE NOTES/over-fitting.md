# over-fitting

Overfitting is a modeling error in machine learning where a function is too closely fit to a limited set of data points. It occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the model will have low generalizability and may perform well on its training data but poorly on test or validation data, as it has essentially memorized the training data rather than learned to generalize from a pattern.
