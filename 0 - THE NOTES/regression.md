# regression

Regression analysis is **the process of estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables** . In simpler words, it means fitting a function from a selected family of functions to the sampled data under some error function.

# Examples

The crosses are relation. We can create a function to map this relation.

Whenever we want to predict the value of something we can refer to what we know.
