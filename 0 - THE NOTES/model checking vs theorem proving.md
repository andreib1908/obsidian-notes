[[model checking]], [[entailment]]

Theorem proving is more concerned with deriving new truths or theorems from existing knowledge using logical inference rules. 

The notation **"KB |- Alpha"** is used in this context. It means that there is a proof or a logical derivation of Alpha from the knowledge base KB using a sequence of inference steps. Theorem proving involves applying rules of inference to deduce new information or to prove theorems from the given axioms and already established theorems. This process can be automated or semi-automated in various theorem-proving systems.

>**KB |- ALPHA IS USED WHEN DERIVING NEW THEOREMS WITH STEPTS SUCH AS CNF (CONJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM).**
>**KB |= ALPHA IS USED FOR ENTAILMENT, I.E. WHEN M(KB) = M(ALPHA), OR WHEN, ACROSS ALL MODELS, KB IS TRUE WHEN ALPHA IS ALSO TRUE.**
