# What is a solution in AI?

A solution to a problem is an action sequence that leads from the initial state to the goal state.

# Solution Quality

It's measured by the Path cost function, the lowest being the optimal solution.

# Main Ingredients for finding a solution

>[!TLDR] Search Space
>Set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of action.
